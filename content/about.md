Some of my earliest memories are of taking minutes with crayons during housing co-op meetings. I didn't fully grasp what quorum meant, but I knew decisions mattered and that if you wanted something to change, you had to get involved.

I've spent most of my life trying to fix things that feel too broken to ignore. From co-ops to climate justice, open-source tools to Indigenous sovereignty, I've worked across movements to shift culture, influence policy, and build systems that put people first.

I've been a party leader, a campaigner, a comms director, and a strategist for public interest tech. I've helped distribute millions in funding for climate action and digital infrastructure, and I still think the best ideas often start with someone asking: What if we just... tried something better?

I care a lot about infosec, OSINT, decentralized governance, and the weird ways power hides in plain sight. I believe in memes as weapons of culture shift, in protocols over platforms, and in laughter as a survival skill.

These days I'm writing a novel called The Monkey Flower Experiment. It's fiction, technically but also a blueprint, a warning, and a love letter to everyone still trying to build something beautiful in the ruins.

As a Canadian I am required to apologize at least once in this page... sorry about that.
