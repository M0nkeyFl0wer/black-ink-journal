            <p>It&#39;s interesting to reflect on where we were when something started, what was motivating us and then consider how our plans turned out.</p>
<p>It was a heck of a lot of work making that event a reality. I joked at the time that it would be like organizing a march but just faster. I was wrong about that and my health suffered along the way in part due to exhaustion. I worked hard and trained hard that year. I went from running my first marathon to barely being able to walk from one room to another in my apartment by the end of the year. But I survived, and when I look at what we accomplished, I&#39;m so glad we took on all that work. So many cool people got involved and so many great organizations pitched in.</p>
<p>If you were at last year&#39;s race, then you know it was pretty magical. There were over 1,100 people coming together to do something collectively in support of climate solutions. There were a lot of kids (especially in the 2.5k around Lost Lagoon) as well as some very impressive athletes.</p>
<p>Over 30 runners finished in 40 minutes or less. One of my friends from high school, David Morrissey, ran the race and finished in second place in the 10k. A cool guy named Matt Harris (far right in this pic in the white socks) who works for LUSH won the 10k race.</p>
<p>There were some hot dogs and superheroes in the race and also all kinds of normal people who preferred a more relaxed approach to running, jogging, walking and strolling their way around the seawall.</p>
<p>We had fun prizes donated by some really cool folks. The winners of best costume won a Sauna Bus adventure.</p>
<p>The fastest team, the Vancouver Falcons, won a trip on a solar-powered catamaran.</p>
<p>The biggest team, the Latin Runners (over 100 members), won a movie screening at the Rio Theatre!</p>
<p>And that was just the tip of the iceberg. Stay tuned for more announcements regarding prizes for this year - go here to get updates and discount codes.</p>
<p>To make that a reality meant months of outreach at all kinds of events. We were at expos, concerts, festivals and farmers markets.</p>
<p>We had over 300 super stoked volunteers on race day and many more in the months before the race. We did dozens of talks about climate change and renewable energy at schools, business lunch-and-learns, running clubs and more.</p>
<p>Another 300 people got involved from other parts of the world as part of our virtual race.</p>
<p>We worked with Climate Smart Businesses to track the carbon footprint of the event and offset all the emissions from travel and production. We had thousands of dollars in donations come in through individual fundraising pages and sponsorships.</p>
<p>When all was said and done, we raised around $40,000 for local solar energy projects (from approximately 1,000 donors), and in the months ahead we will be announcing the solar energy projects we are helping to have installed on the roofs of non-profit organizations in BC. Stay tuned for announcements.</p>
<p>This year the race in Vancouver - and the virtual race - will both be bigger and better. That means even more work, but I&#39;m not worried because the network of people making it a reality is growing. I&#39;m focusing on self-care and inspired by the desire of so many people to come together and make climate solutions a reality.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who was involved in our first year. If you missed it last year, now is the perfect time to start planning for this year or even to volunteer to help out this summer or join us on a training run or two. Working together, we can have a huge impactâ€¦ one step at a time.</p>
