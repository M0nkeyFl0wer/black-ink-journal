        <p>Dear Commissioner Paulson,</p>

        <p>As a climate activist and concerned citizen, I am writing to urge the RCMP to recognize the urgent threat that climate change poses to national security and to reconsider the approach to policing climate activism.</p>

        <h2>Climate Change as a Security Threat</h2>
        <p>Leading security experts and government agencies worldwide have identified climate change as a major threat to public safety, infrastructure, and social stability. The RCMP has a responsibility to protect Canadians from these risks.</p>

        <h2>Policing Climate Activism</h2>
        <p>Recent actions against climate activists have raised concerns about the balance between security and civil liberties. Peaceful protest and advocacy are essential to democracy and should not be treated as threats.</p>

        <div style="text-align:center; margin: 2em 0;">

            <div style="font-size: 0.95em; color: #888; margin-top: 0.5em;">RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson</div>
        </div>

        <h2>A Call for Dialogue</h2>
        <p>I urge the RCMP to engage in open dialogue with climate activists and to prioritize the protection of human rights while addressing security concerns. Together, we can work toward a safer, more sustainable future for all Canadians.</p>

        <p>Sincerely,<br>Ben West</p>
