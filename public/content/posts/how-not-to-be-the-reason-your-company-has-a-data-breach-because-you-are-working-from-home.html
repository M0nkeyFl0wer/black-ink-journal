            <p>I created this list of tools years ago for friends exploring privacy and security related software and I have been updating it and editing it since the pandemic lock downs as more people began working from home. At the time many people I knew were asking me about options to better secure their devices. Why are people asking me?</p>

<p>I'm not a registered cybersecurity expert, I'm just a person who started paying more and more attention to this stuff after having some of my accounts compromised and learning I was being <a href="https://bccla.org/secret-spy-hearings/?utm_source=vancouver+is+awesome&utm_campaign=vancouver+is+awesome%3A+outbound&utm_medium=referral">surveilled by government and industry as an activist</a> fighting the expansion of heavy oil pipelines in BC.</p>

<p>I have learned a lot since then and have explored using many different tools to provide safety and security for myself and for my work.</p>

<p>Privacy and security tools are not just for activist, celebrities and journalists. Privacy is a form of power, your personal information is valuable, and far too easily to criminals along with governments and corporations. Just like nobody questions why we have blinds on our homes the same should be true for our privacy and security.</p>

<p>This is perhaps especially significant when you are responsible not only for your own privacy and security but when your devices are tied to the private business information and/or user accounts associated with your employer.</p>

<p>Something to consider: Security and privacy and different but connected. Being good a security will increase your privacy in terms of who has access to your files and personal information. But not everything that is good for security is also good for privacy.</p>

<h2>Where to Start</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most important first thing you can do in terms of security is to take a look at if your existing accounts have been part of any hacks or "data breaches". If you put your email into this tool from Mozilla it will compare it against a large database of all known data breaches and show you if any of your accounts associated with your email has been compromised. This is a free service from Firefox. You will find out if you need to go change your password anywhere right away or if any other information about you has been leaked. Its scary to see how many data breaches take place. Its a big reason the tools and tips in this article are important.</p>

<p>Find out if you've been part of a data breach with ⁨Mozilla Monitor⁩. We'll help you understand what to do next and…monitor.firefox.com</p>

<p>Its very important to not use the same user name and password on multiple different services. The most common way to get hacked is for people to use lists of emails and passwords from one breach to try to access user accounts on other services. This can be done with bots and often you won't even know you have lost access to your accounts until its too late. If nothing else use better passwords for work and banking and medical stuff. Passwords managers are a god send in terms of better password management. If you only do one thing from this article switching to using a password manager should be it.</p>

<h2>Password Manager</h2>

<p>There are a ton of different options in this category. Just using the password manager built into your browser is better than nothing but ideally you would use a tool like BitWarden or 1Password. I prefer BitWarden because its open source and the pricing is better than most of the alternatives for more advanced features.</p>

<p>Convenient browser extensions exist for both these tools that work on Firefox or Chrome and Safari too. That makes it a really convenient way to manage all your passwords in apps and on your browser. You can also manage secure notes and credit card information for filling form fields when paying for things.</p>

<p>The real hardcores generally opt for KeyPass which doesn't connect to the internet but that involves a bit more work to get it set up and to transfer stuff from one place to another. I'm guessing if you are reading this you probably aren't one of those hardcore privacy focused people you are just a regular person who wants to be a bit more secure, in that case I would suggest BitWarden and their browser extension. The free version is good enough for most people and it works great on desktop and on the phone.</p>

<p>Bitwarden is the most trusted password manager for passwords and passkeys at home or at work, on any browser or device…bitwarden.com</p>

<h2>Two Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>

<p>Using a second way to identify you when you log into a site after you enter your password or "Two factor authentication" (2FA) might be a bit annoying when you are trying to log into something but it really is essential for anything important. Unfortunately not many banks or credit card companies have it set up on their websites which I find bizarre. But you probably can use it for many important things like your works email system and your own email (which is probably used for back up codes for anything you lose access to and can be exploited by hackers to get access to anything where its used that way). Its way better to use an app that creates authentication tokens as opposed to using SMS text messages for 2FA.</p>

<p>Unfortunately sharing your phone number can be a vulnerability. "Sim jacking" or sim swapping is what hackers call it when they pretend to be you and get services transferred away from your phone to their phone and then they have the ability to get around your 2FA. More on that below.</p>

<p>So for 2FA I like Authy. Again it works on all platforms and easy to set up and secure and easy to restore from backup (unlike Google Authenticator). Good User experience compared to other options. Some say it is more secure to use something that doesn't connect to the internet but unless you are particularly at risk of being targeted by hackers its still way better than not using 2FA and its convenient and easy to set up.</p>

<h2>Malware Protection</h2>

<p>Its easy to say be careful what you click on but in reality the internet was built to be a series of connections between sites based on links. Its pretty hard to avoid ever clicking on the wrong thing given the circumstances.</p>

<p>One of the best tools to protect yourself in this environment is MalwareBytes, you can use this tool to scan your device regularly to be sure you don't have any known malware on your device. And for extra protection consider using the paid version of MalwareBytes which will block you from clicking on successfully clicking on any links or downloading any files that put your computer at risk.</p>

<p><a href="https://malwarebytes.com/?source=post_page-----cf65c38d3602---------------------------------------">Official Site | Malwarebytes: Antivirus, Anti-Malware & Privacy</a></p>

<p>Malwarebytes offers real-time antivirus, advanced anti-malware and privacy protection for all your devices. Launched in…malwarebytes.com</p>

<p>Its also important to update your device to the latest security patches as generally hackers and malware exploit these vulnerabilities that are blocked by security patches.</p>

<h2>Private Phone Numbers</h2>

<p>Its generally best to not use your own cell number for online shopping or sharing it in other ways online. Sim swapping happens because hackers find your phone number associated with your name during data breaches or via data brokers. Your phone number can also be a way to track you remotely because your cellphone sends "pings" regularly to cell towers and this is actually reasonably easy information to get your hands on sadly. Even if you aren't concerned about that (and you should) but to some people the most important reason not to use your own phone number for online shopping is because it will dramatically reduce the amount of spam calls you get on your phone.</p>

<p>This tool is also useful for getting secondary phone numbers in different area codes, separate work/ personal numbers and it's great for online shopping or online dating. As mentioned before this is especially important as increasingly hackers use SIM hacking to take over peoples cell phones. Avoid using SMS text messages for 2 factor authentication.</p>

<p><a href="https://mysudo.com/?source=post_page-----cf65c38d3602---------------------------------------">MySudo</a></p>

<p>Protect you r privacy and identity with MySudo. Talk, text, email, browse, and pay privately all in one place.mysudo.com</p>

<p>Sudo is a great app for both iPhone and Android and has a desktop version for Mac (hopefully soon on Windows as well). They give you a free phone number you can use for online shopping, dating etc. It can also be useful if you want to use a separate number for work and personal use. The paid plans are reasonable if you want to make this your primary phone. Experts suggest never giving anyone your actual phone number and just using the forwarding numbers created by a service like Sudo. There are other options but I think this one is the best and easiest to set up. Services like Twillio can do even more and are customizable but it takes some knowledge and time to set up.</p>

<h2>Instant Messaging and Video Calls (end to end encrypted)</h2>

<p>A better option than traditional phone calls and text messages is using an encrypted messaging app like Signal. Instead of using WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger a lot of people are switching to Signal or other end to end encrypted apps for messaging and video calls internationall...
