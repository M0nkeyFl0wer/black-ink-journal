            At the recent swearing-in ceremony for Canada's newest ministers, one detail stood out. Not the cabinet picks (we could talk about that too), but the words they were made to say: a solemn pledge of allegiance to "His Majesty King Charles the Third, his heirs and successors."

            In 2025. In a modern democracy. In a country where we pride ourselves on being independent, progressive, and self-governing, we are still asking ministers to pledge fealty not to the people, not even to the Constitution, but to a literal king.

            Let's be clear. This isn't just ceremonial fluff. Canada may pretend to be a modern democracy with a decorative crown, but the reality is more twisted. We are a monarchy pretending not to be one. The consequences of that show up in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.

            Today, King Charles III is delivering the Speech from the Throne. This marks the first time in 48 years that a reigning monarch has done so in Canada, and only the third time ever. Queen Elizabeth II read the speech in 1957 and again in 1977, both during symbolic royal tours. But this one hits differently. It is not just a visit. It is a reminder.

            Because while the Republican Party in the U.S. has rallied behind a man who believes he is a king, here we are in Canada claiming we are not one, while having our ministers swear loyalty to a royal family. It is cosplay constitutionalism. And I say this with respect to cosplay.

            The irony goes deeper. People who oppose monarchy are often labeled republicans, as if rejecting hereditary power aligns them with the authoritarian brand now controlling the U.S. Republican Party. We need a better word. Because the answer to one totalitarian regime is not to run back to the mothership of imperial institutions and a deeply corrupt family.

            Now, you might be saying, "Ben, come on. The monarchy doesn't really have power in Canada." But it does. Not in the daily business of government, no. But in moments of crisis, the Crown's representatives, our Governor General and the Lieutenant Governors, hold real reserve powers. They have exercised them before. They could again.

              Remember 2017? Christy Clark, then Premier of British Columbia, lost the confidence of the Legislature. Rather than dissolve Parliament as she requested, Lieutenant Governor Judith Guichon invited John Horgan to form government. That is not just a ribbon-cutting role. That is power.

            Or take Stephen Harper's 2008 prorogation crisis. Facing a confidence vote he was likely to lose, he asked the Governor General to prorogue Parliament. MichaÃ«lle Jean agreed. Many framed it as a wise avoidance of crisis. But in truth, a majority of MPs had signed a letter expressing their desire to form an alternative government. The Governor General made a choice. She backed the sitting Prime Minister instead of the stated will of the majority. That is not democratic restraint. That is institutional bias dressed up as neutrality.
