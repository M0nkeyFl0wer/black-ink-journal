- `vite.config.ts` - Build tool configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Styling configuration
- `scripts/` - All recovery and utility scripts
- `supabase/` - Database integration code
- `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Complete setup guide

## Next Steps for Local Setup

### 1. **Install Cursor on Ubuntu**
```bash
# Download from https://cursor.sh
# Or use the .deb package for Ubuntu
```

### 2. **Restore Your Project**
```bash
# Copy your project to local machine
# Run: npm install
# Start development: npm run dev
```

### 3. **Install Extensions**
- Follow `CURSOR_EXTENSIONS.md` for recommended extensions
- Use the quick install script if you want to install all at once

### 4. **Verify Recovery**
```bash
# Test your recovery scripts
node scripts/recover-posts-from-supabase.cjs

# Check your content
ls content/posts/
cat content/about.md
```

## Key Learnings

### ✅ **What Worked Well**
- **Supabase recovery** - Direct database access was the key
- **Markdown conversion** - HTML to markdown conversion preserved formatting
- **Image preservation** - All images recovered with proper links
- **Script automation** - Automated the entire recovery process

### 🎯 **Docker vs Local**
- **Docker was educational** but not necessary for this project
- **Local development** will be faster and more reliable
- **All tools and extensions** can be preserved locally

### 💡 **Future Improvements**
- **Static site generation** - Your content is ready for static builds
- **Markdown editing** - Easy content management going forward
- **No more database dependency** - Your content is now portable
