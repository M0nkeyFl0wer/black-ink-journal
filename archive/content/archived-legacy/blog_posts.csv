Let me put that another way. I have a friendly suggestion. Instead of having to ridiculously call out to Alexa or Siri or, sadly even worse, sharing the awkward indignity of triggering a response by repeatedly saying ""ok Google"" in public (That's what I've found myself saying a lot recently), I have a suggestion for what could work better.

Now first, don't get me wrong-I love Google Assistant. I can now push a button on my hearing aid and trigger Google Assistant at any time via Bluetooth. Because my pricey headphones are pretty much invisible, I am often that guy who looks like he's talking to himself walking down the street while fetching directions or trying to remember some asinine trivia.

But that's not enough to dissuade me. I love it. I finally feel like the cyborg I always wanted to be. I can push a button on my chest, like a com badge on Star Trek, and unleash the power of the internet.

I can now use a voice command to send a message to satellites and around the world to servers in Hong Kong and then back again to turn off my TV without having to locate a remote control under a cushion on my couch. Long story short-ish... I'm on board. I just have an idea for how we can make it better regardless of which self-inflicted surveillance device you prefer.

My idea is this: let's just say ""Please and Thank You"" to begin and end disembodied robot interactions. No goofy names over and over and over… just a polite request to the invisible wizards. As in, instead of saying ""Ok Google, please turn off the TV"" you just say ""Please turn off the TV"".

If Alexa starts rambling on about something you didn't want in the kitchen while your whole family tries to eat dinner, then instead of everyone yelling ""Alexa stop"" or ""Alexa shut up"" (which works as a voice command, by the way), now they could all just yell out ""Thank You"". Much better, right?

Because my mom raised me right, I often say please and thank you anyways when I ask for things from my virtual assistant. I even thank the toaster sometimes for doing its job so well. But I'm sure there are lots of times I could have been more considerate.

If we are going to bark commands at our computers all day now, the least we could do is be polite, don't you think? Maybe it might even train us all to be a bit more congenial in the real world?

Currently, I don't think we will be accidentally triggering our devices very much. We could all be a lot more friendly these days, right? How about using this new trend towards voice commands as motivation for renewed civility.

Given all the work Google has clearly done to be able to distinguish natural language and type on a screen whatever nonsense falls out of our mouths, it seems weird to me that they hadn't thought about how unnatural it is to say this goofy stuff out loud all day long before they tattooed the phrase all over the city of Las Vegas for this year's CES.

Again, I say this with love. I'm typing (and swiping) this right now on a Google Pixel 2 XL. I brought my new Alexa on the plane with me to Toronto like a pet rock. Trained it with my mom and then left it with her as Google Assistant became my go-to.

By the way, Assistant is so much better… especially when you just have to squeeze your phone or hold down a button on your chest to start a conversation with the electronic hive mind. Maybe soon we all will have trigger buttons sewn into our clothes, but this voice command change is important even just for the dignity of naked guys in the shower in the future. Don't make them shout ""Ok Google"" to turn up the music while they are bathing. How about just saying ""Please turn up the volume"" and before you know it, you are boogying in a bathtub.

We should all politely request that no matter who makes a voice command device, we all have the option to just say please and thank you to their robots.

And by the way, if the robots are gonna have names, maybe you should let us name our new family members. ;) Seriously though, if you want us to love these things, let us personalize them more. But anyways… it's early.

There are still lots of other issues to address before we are all living the life of lazy luxury we are hoping for. I can't wait to talk crypto prices with an Alphabet brain and buy Bitcoin hands-free on the couch while a robot vacuum cleaner uses lasers to attack the dog hair on the floor. My coffee already tastes a bit better thanks to boiling water with a ""good morning"" shortcut. But often the commands don't work as planned, and I, like most people, have yet to replace all my appliances with versions that can tell bad jokes and order replacement batteries.

Now is a good moment as we all take trepidatious steps into this voice-activated world to pause and consider what will make the difference between a novelty and something we aren't embarrassed to use in public?

So what do you say? Please, Alexa? Ok, Google?
Thank you.",https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*GDpWu5sqYXlyYoBypCwGhw.jpeg,Ben West,2024-12-05 00:00:00+00,"[""technology"",""ai"",""voice assistants"",""commentary""]",true,2025-06-05 02:30:10.964504+00,2025-06-05 02:30:10.964504+00,admin,admin

At the time many people I knew were asking me about options to better secure their devices. Why are people asking me?</p>

<p>I'm not a registered cybersecurity expert, I'm just a person who started paying more and more attention to this stuff after having some of my accounts compromised and learning I was being <a href=""https://bccla.org/secret-spy-hearings/?utm_source=vancouver+is+awesome&utm_campaign=vancouver+is+awesome%3A+outbound&utm_medium=referral"">surveilled by government and industry as an activist</a> fighting the expansion of heavy oil pipelines in BC.</p>

<p>I have learned a lot since then and have explored using many different tools to provide safety and security for myself and for my work.</p>

<p>Privacy and security tools are not just for activist, celebrities and journalists. Privacy is a form of power, your personal information is valuable, and far too easily to criminals along with governments and corporations. Just like nobody questions why we have blinds on our homes the same should be true for our privacy and security.</p>

<p>This is perhaps especially significant when you are responsible not only for your own privacy and security but when your devices are tied to the private business information and/or user accounts associated with your employer.</p>

<p>Something to consider: Security and privacy and different but connected. Being good a security will increase your privacy in terms of who has access to your files and personal information. But not everything that is good for security is also good for privacy.</p>

<h2>Where to Start</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most important first thing you can do in terms of security is to take a look at if your existing accounts have been part of any hacks or ""data breaches"". If you put your email into this tool from Mozilla it will compare it against a large database of all known data breaches and show you if any of your accounts associated with your email has been compromised. This is a free service from Firefox. You will find out if you need to go change your password anywhere right away or if any other information about you has been leaked. Its scary to see how many data breaches take place. Its a big reason the tools and tips in this article are important.</p>

<p><a href=""https://monitor.firefox.com/?source=post_page-----cf65c38d3602---------------------------------------"">Mozilla Monitor</a></p>

<p>Find out if you've been part of a data breach with ⁨Mozilla Monitor⁩. We'll help you understand what to do next and…monitor.firefox.com</p>

<p>Its very important to not use the same user name and password on multiple different services. The most common way to get hacked is for people to use lists of emails and passwords from one breach to try to access user accounts on other services. This can be done with bots and often you won't even know you have lost access to your accounts until its too late. If nothing else use better passwords for work and banking and medical stuff. Passwords managers are a god send in terms of better password management. If you only do one thing from this article switching to using a password manager should be it.</p>

<h2>Password Manager</h2>

<p>There are a ton of different options in this category. Just using the password manager built into your browser is better than nothing but ideally you would use a tool like BitWarden or 1Password. I prefer BitWarden because its open source and the pricing is better than most of the alternatives for more advanced features.</p>

<p>Convenient browser extensions exist for both these tools that work on Firefox or Chrome and Safari too. That makes it a really convenient way to manage all your passwords in apps and on your browser. You can also manage secure notes and credit card information for filling form fields when paying for things.</p>

<p>The real hardcores generally opt for KeyPass which doesn't connect to the internet but that involves a bit more work to get it set up and to transfer stuff from one place to another. I'm guessing if you are reading this you probably aren't one of those hardcore privacy focused people you are just a regular person who wants to be a bit more secure, in that case I would suggest BitWarden and their browser extension. The free version is good enough for most people and it works great on desktop and on the phone.</p>

<p>Bitwarden is the most trusted password manager for passwords and passkeys at home or at work, on any browser or device…bitwarden.com</p>

<h2>Two Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>

<p>Using a second way to identify you when you log into a site after you enter your password or ""Two factor authentication"" (2FA) might be a bit annoying when you are trying to log into something but it really is essential for anything important. Unfortunately not many banks or credit card companies have it set up on their websites which I find bizarre. But you probably can use it for many important things like your works email system and your own email (which is probably used for back up codes for anything you lose access to and can be exploited by hackers to get access to anything where its used that way). Its way better to use an app that creates authentication tokens as opposed to using SMS text messages for 2FA.</p>

<p>Unfortunately sharing your phone number can be a vulnerability. ""Sim jacking"" or sim swapping is what hackers call it when they pretend to be you and get services transferred away from your phone to their phone and then they have the ability to get around your 2FA. More on that below.</p>

<p>So for 2FA I like Authy. Again it works on all platforms and easy to set up and secure and easy to restore from backup (unlike Google Authenticator). Good User experience compared to other options. Some say it is more secure to use something that doesn't connect to the internet but unless you are particularly at risk of being targeted by hackers its still way better than not using 2FA and its convenient and easy to set up.</p>

<h2>Malware Protection</h2>

<p>Its easy to say be careful what you click on but in reality the internet was built to be a series of connections between sites based on links. Its pretty hard to avoid ever clicking on the wrong thing given the circumstances.</p>

<p>One of the best tools to protect yourself in this environment is MalwareBytes, you can use this tool to scan your device regularly to be sure you don't have any known malware on your device. And for extra protection consider using the paid version of MalwareBytes which will block you from clicking on successfully clicking on any links or downloading any files that put your computer at risk.</p>

<p><a href=""https://malwarebytes.com/?source=post_page-----cf65c38d3602---------------------------------------"">Official Site | Malwarebytes: Antivirus, Anti-Malware & Privacy</a></p>

<p>Malwarebytes offers real-time antivirus, advanced anti-malware and privacy protection for all your devices. Launched in…malwarebytes.com</p>

<p>Its also important to update your device to the latest security patches as generally hackers and malware exploit these vulnerabilities that are blocked by security patches.</p>

<h2>Private Phone Numbers</h2>

<p>Its generally best to not use your own cell number for online shopping or sharing it in other ways online. Sim swapping happens because hackers find your phone number associated with your name during data breaches or via data brokers. Your phone number can also be a way to track you remotely because your cellphone sends ""pings"" regularly to cell towers and this is actually reasonably easy information to get your hands on sadly. Even if you aren't concerned about that (and you should) but to some people the most important reason not to use your own phone number for online shopping is because it will dramatically reduce the amount of spam calls you get on your phone.</p>

<p>This tool is also useful for getting secondary phone numbers in different area codes, separate work/ personal numbers and it's great for online shopping or online dating. As mentioned before this is especially important as increasingly hackers use SIM hacking to take over peoples cell phones. Avoid using SMS text messages for 2 factor authentication.</p>

<p><a href=""https://mysudo.com/?source=post_page-----cf65c38d3602---------------------------------------"">MySudo</a></p>

<p>Protect you r privacy and identity with MySudo. Talk, text, email, browse, and pay privately all in one place.mysudo.com</p>

<p>Sudo is a great app for both iPhone and Android and has a desktop version for Mac (hopefully soon on Windows as well). They give you a free phone number you can use for online shopping, dating etc. It can also be useful if you want to use a separate number for work and personal use. The paid plans are reasonable if you want to make this your primary phone. Experts suggest never giving anyone your actual phone number and just using the forwarding numbers created by a service like Sudo. There are other options but I think this one is the best and easiest to set up. Services like Twillio can do even more and are customizable but it takes some knowledge and time to set up.</p>

<h2>Instant Messaging and Video Calls (end to end encrypted)</h2>

<p>A better option than traditional phone calls and text messages is using an encrypted messaging app like Signal.

Unlocking the Power of Non-Financial Blockchain Tech as Climate Solutions 🌏

Much of the discussion around blockchain technology is often focused on cryptocurrencies or the plethora of meme coins and scams that are often built on top. Yet as the world struggles to address the urgency of the climate crisis, blockchain has the potential to be a game-changer in the murky waters of international coordination, resource allocation, and international accountability. Innovative crypto financial instruments and 'tokenomics' may play an important role as climate solutions, but let's a step back to examine some of the core applications of the evolving foundational technology itself...

Carbon Accounting 🧮

It's been said that what gets measured gets done. Accurate carbon accounting is critical if we are going to get serious about climate action. Yet currently, carbon accounting is done using a hodgepodge of non-standardized, jurisdictional, and proprietary carbon accounting tools and methodologies. These systems lack interoperability, are not easily monitored or verified, and are prone to centralized server operational security (opSec) vulnerabilities.

Using standardized, decentralized, free open source protocols could create a foundation for widely used and more useful carbon accounting at all levels of government. Organizations such as Blockchain for Climate and the Open Earth Foundation are leading this charge with government pilot projects around the world to implement robust and verifiable systems for monitoring and managing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). 🙌

Supply Chain Management 🏭

Global supply chains suffer from many of the same challenges as carbon accounting: expensive vendor lock-in, data fragmentation and inaccessibility. This makes it challenging to create critical efficiencies or to have international accountability.

Blockchain can be a neutral, transparent and universal foundation for applications that ensure traceability, allowing every transaction and movement of goods to be recorded on an immutable ledger and verified in real-time. Zero-knowledge proofs also provide new opportunities to protect trade secrets while retaining reliable verification of data.

Organizations like Permet Systems and The New Fork (Open Food Chain) are two leading examples building real-world templates for scaling this kind of infrastructure in their industries (fashion and food). 🙌

Impact Certificates, Decentralized Identity, and Oracles 🪩

Individual actions play an important role in creating positive impact from the bottom up. By bringing this valuable data on-chain, we may be able to unleash scalable databases of impact certificates with trust and accountability. This approach would create a true ""resume of good work"" for participants. Consider the Hypercerts primitive, which can be built to acknowledge and reward individuals who support renewable energy projects, reduce carbon emissions, adopt regenerative agriculture methods, or create any other form of positive impact.

A key building block for this kind of infrastructure is decentralized identity - the idea that individuals should be able to have control over their digital identities without relying on centralized authorities or intermediaries. For example, protocols like Gitcoin Passport enable individuals to verify their personhood and then connect this to the impact work attributable to them.

On the other side, once a person (or their handle) is identified, how is the impact they create verified? In the case of carbon mitigation projects, MRV (monitoring, reporting and verification) depends on data collected from sources such as satellites, drones and on-the-ground sensors. Oracles are the software that brings this valuable data on-chain and they play a key role in carbon accounting and crediting, as well as in creative strategies around crop insurance and the incentivization of GHG reduction strategies in agriculture, oceans, and forestry. Shamba Network and Astral Protocol have both been pioneers in this work. 🙌

Let's build together 🫡

In conclusion, while international coordination remains a significant obstacle to climate action, non-financial blockchain technology offers promising solutions. Yet it is important to note that while this technology holds great potential, it is not a panacea to fix all of humanity's woes. Furthermore, to truly harness its potential, we must shift gears from talking and speculating to building, doing, and demonstrating. We must embrace a collaborative mindset, recognizing that blockchain technology is a catalyst that requires collective efforts to unleash its full potential. By combining our expertise, resources, and ambitions, we can harness the power of blockchain to drive meaningful change and accelerate progress towards a more sustainable, resilient, and regenerative future. Let's grow 🌱

If you want to dive deeper into these ideas keep an eye out for interesting events and activities on Gitcoin's community hub pages. We will be sharing talks and hackathons as well as opportunities to get involved in exciting projects and even earn impact certificates.",https://www.benwest.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Roundup-67-1024x532.jpeg,Ben West,2023-06-07 00:00:00+00,"[""technology"",""climate""]",true,2025-06-05 03:13:01.638101+00,2025-06-05 03:13:01.638101+00,admin,admin

It was a heck of a lot of work making that event a reality. I joked at the time that it would be like organizing a march but just faster. I was wrong about that and my health suffered along the way in part due to exhaustion. I worked hard and trained hard that year. I went from running my first marathon to barely being able to walk from one room to another in my apartment by the end of the year. But I survived, and when I look at what we accomplished, I'm so glad we took on all that work. So many cool people got involved and so many great organizations pitched in.

If you were at last year's race, then you know it was pretty magical. There were over 1,100 people coming together to do something collectively in support of climate solutions. There were a lot of kids (especially in the 2.5k around Lost Lagoon) as well as some very impressive athletes.

Over 30 runners finished in 40 minutes or less. One of my friends from high school, David Morrissey, ran the race and finished in second place in the 10k. A cool guy named Matt Harris (far right in this pic in the white socks) who works for LUSH won the 10k race.

There were some hot dogs and superheroes in the race and also all kinds of normal people who preferred a more relaxed approach to running, jogging, walking and strolling their way around the seawall.

We had fun prizes donated by some really cool folks. The winners of best costume won a Sauna Bus adventure.

The fastest team, the Vancouver Falcons, won a trip on a solar-powered catamaran.

The biggest team, the Latin Runners (over 100 members), won a movie screening at the Rio Theatre!

And that was just the tip of the iceberg. Stay tuned for more announcements regarding prizes for this year - go here to get updates and discount codes.

To make that a reality meant months of outreach at all kinds of events. We were at expos, concerts, festivals and farmers markets.

We had over 300 super stoked volunteers on race day and many more in the months before the race. We did dozens of talks about climate change and renewable energy at schools, business lunch-and-learns, running clubs and more.

Another 300 people got involved from other parts of the world as part of our virtual race.

We worked with Climate Smart Businesses to track the carbon footprint of the event and offset all the emissions from travel and production. We had thousands of dollars in donations come in through individual fundraising pages and sponsorships.

When all was said and done, we raised around $40,000 for local solar energy projects (from approximately 1,000 donors), and in the months ahead we will be announcing the solar energy projects we are helping to have installed on the roofs of non-profit organizations in BC. Stay tuned for announcements.

This year the race in Vancouver - and the virtual race - will both be bigger and better. That means even more work, but I'm not worried because the network of people making it a reality is growing. I'm focusing on self-care and inspired by the desire of so many people to come together and make climate solutions a reality.

Thanks to everyone who was involved in our first year. If you missed it last year, now is the perfect time to start planning for this year or even to volunteer to help out this summer or join us on a training run or two.

  <p>At the recent swearing-in ceremony for Canada's newest ministers, one detail stood out. Not the cabinet picks (we could talk about that too), but the words they were made to say: a solemn pledge of allegiance to ""His Majesty King Charles the Third, his heirs and successors.""</p>
  
  <p>In 2025. In a modern democracy. In a country where we pride ourselves on being independent, progressive, and self-governing, we are still asking ministers to pledge fealty not to the people, not even to the Constitution, but to a literal king.</p>

  <p>And not just a king. This king. The guy who couldn't even get his own pens to work during his coronation tour. The guy who wears jewels stolen from colonized nations and sits atop an institution built on centuries of slavery, imperialism, and violent dispossession.</p>
  
  <p>Let's be clear. This isn't just ceremonial fluff. Canada may pretend to be a modern democracy with a decorative crown, but the reality is more twisted. We are a monarchy pretending not to be one. The consequences of that show up in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.</p>
  
  <p>Today, King Charles III is delivering the Speech from the Throne. This marks the first time in 48 years that a reigning monarch has done so in Canada, and only the third time ever. Queen Elizabeth II read the speech in 1957 and again in 1977, both during symbolic royal tours. But this one hits differently. It is not just a visit. It is a reminder.</p>

    <p class=""text-center text-gray-400 text-sm mt-4 italic"">Still here. Still crowned.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>A symbolic move, sure. But symbols matter. And in the context of a rising authoritarian wave south of the border, the timing feels more than ironic.</p>
  
  <p>Because while the Republican Party in the U.S. has rallied behind a man who believes he is a king, here we are in Canada claiming we are not one, while having our ministers swear loyalty to a royal family. It is cosplay constitutionalism. And I say this with respect to cosplay.</p>
  
  <p>The irony goes deeper. People who oppose monarchy are often labeled republicans, as if rejecting hereditary power aligns them with the authoritarian brand now controlling the U.S. Republican Party. We need a better word. Because the answer to one totalitarian regime is not to run back to the mothership of imperial institutions and a deeply corrupt family.</p>

  </div>
  
  <p>Now, you might be saying, ""Ben, come on. The monarchy doesn't really have power in Canada."" But it does. Not in the daily business of government, no. But in moments of crisis, the Crown's representatives, our Governor General and the Lieutenant Governors, hold real reserve powers. They have exercised them before. They could again.</p>
  
  <p>Remember 2017? Christy Clark, then Premier of British Columbia, lost the confidence of the Legislature. Rather than dissolve Parliament as she requested, Lieutenant Governor Judith Guichon invited John Horgan to form government. That is not just a ribbon-cutting role. That is power.</p>
  
  <p>Or take Stephen Harper's 2008 prorogation crisis. Facing a confidence vote he was likely to lose, he asked the Governor General to prorogue Parliament. Michaëlle Jean agreed. Many framed it as a wise avoidance of crisis. But in truth, a majority of MPs had signed a letter expressing their desire to form an alternative government. The Governor General made a choice. She backed the sitting Prime Minister instead of the stated will of the majority. That is not democratic restraint. That is institutional bias dressed up as neutrality.</p>

  </div>
  
  <p>Mark Carney, now Prime Minister and former head of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, has defended this arrangement as a bulwark of Canadian sovereignty. But is it? Or is it just stability through tradition? Are we clinging to symbols of empire to avoid real conversations about democratic renewal?</p>
  
  <p>Our sovereignty should reflect our values. It should be rooted in accountability, justice, and the will of the people, not a colonial tradition or a crown passed down by birthright. We are more than a subject nation, and our future depends on acting like it.</p>

My colleagues from ForestEthics (NOTE: the organization has now changed their name to Stand.Earth) in the United States have just launched a new website, Blast-Zone.org, which shows the risk along oil-by-rail routes in North America. It's shocking just how many people are living in the danger zones.

This is, of course, a new threat we have all become more aware of due to the horrible tragedy at Lac-Mégantic, Quebec. We've just passed the one year anniversary of this unforgettable day and it was commemorated last week by citizens in various cities organizing events along rail shipping routes.

Folks are waking up to this threat in the U.S., but here in Canada it's becoming a more complicated conversation as it relates to highly controversial pipeline project proposals.

I'm glad there's growing awareness of the risks posed by oil by rail. But let's face it, the proponents of pipelines like Enbridge and Kinder Morgan are also happy about this; as I say, they may even appreciate the new ForestEthics website.

Why would they like this website? Well, my experience as an anti-pipeline campaigner sums it up. These days I find myself being asked the same question over and over again, ""Yes, but what about the exploding trains, aren't pipelines safer?""

This is a false choice. The answer is none of the above. The ""choice"" between pipelines and rail is like asking what's better for you, chewing tobacco or smoking cigarettes? Both are extremely dangerous and highly toxic. The only real solution is to quit tobacco.

Like with the tobacco industry, it's in fact many of the same companies looking to profit from both of these false choices. Kinder Morgan, which is behind the massive new TransMountain pipeline proposed from Alberta to Vancouver Harbour, have also recently invested heavily in a new oil-by-rail terminal in Edmonton.

With the success of the campaigns against Keystone XL, Enbridge Northern Gateway, and other pipelines in North America, the oil industry is trying to use rail infrastructure as a back door route to get around public scrutiny and democratic consultation processes.

For the communities in the path of Big Oil, it doesn't matter so much whether it's travelling by rail or pipeline. Those who have faced a spill will tell you that no family should have to live with the threat of crude oil poisoning their community.

As we run out of easy-to-access conventional crude oil globally and shift to unconventional fuels like heavy tar sands bitumen and shale oil from rocks, the problems of finding, mining, refining, and burning oil are compounded. Conventional crude spills like the Exxon Valdez caused immeasurable harm, but unconventional oil products are even worse. Tar sands spills have proven to be even more difficult to clean up, as we learned from Enbridge's spill in the Kalamazoo River, and shale oil has a tendency to explode, as we learned at Lac Megantic.

Unconventional fuels come with a bigger price tag not only in terms of the risks but also in terms of dollars and cents. The price of gas at the pump is only going up and the subsidies to industry to facilitate the shift to more expensive extraction of these bottom-of-the-barrel fuels is coming out of taxpayers' pockets. It really is nuts for our hard-earned loonies to be going to some of the wealthiest corporations in the world, especially given the disregard the oil industry has shown for human health and safety.

The only reason the oil industry can get away with framing the question as rail versus pipeline is that we are being led to believe that there are not currently viable alternatives.

The good news is they are wrong and it's time we all start talking about it.

Did you know that more people today work in the solar panel industry than in the coal and gas industries combined in the United States? Did you know the second best stock on NASDAQ last year was a Canadian renewable energy company called Canadian Solar? Did you know that Tesla Motors is now the biggest auto industry employer in California? Did you know that the World Bank has recently put out a report that says renewable energy is a 2.6 trillion dollar a year opportunity? Did you know that the International Energy Agency says that not only can we decarbonize and meet global energy demand from renewable sources but it will actually save the global economy approximately 71 trillion dollars by 2050?

So it's not about rail versus pipelines, but about whether we are going to be part of the emerging new energy and transportation economy. We should be moving people on those trains, not fossils.

I'm confident that Canadians are savvy enough to see through the industry spin. We want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. That's bad news for Big Oil and good news for everyone else.",https://i0.wp.com/www.benwest.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/FEA_Trains6_2431.jpg?w=1000&ssl=1,Ben West,2014-07-23 00:00:00+00,"[""environment"",""energy"",""pipelines"",""transportation"",""policy""]",true,2025-06-05 02:32:46.248973+00,2025-06-05 02:32:46.248973+00,admin,admin

Earlier this summer it filled my heart with pride and joy to watch my good friend Chief Rueben George, stand before the sacred tree in the Arbor of a Sun Dance ceremony in Lakota territory, South Dakota and read a declaration of indigenous spiritual leaders against tar sands pipelines and tankers.

Rueben and I met a couple years ago as allies working to stop Houston-based oil giant Kinder Morgan, from building a new pipeline that would bring over 400 oil tankers a year into Vancouver's Burrard Inlet. Rueben's people, the Tsleil-Waututh Nation (which means people of the inlet), have been the stewards of Burrard Inlet since time immemorial.

We have become good friends over the last couple years and my life has been so enriched by opportunities, such as taking part in ceremony, and learning of ancient stories and teaching. In the last year I have taken on the role of fire keeper for Rueben's sweat lodge, a huge honour. Our friendship now led me, a white Jewish guy with roots in Eastern Europe born in Vancouver, to join Rueben on a trip to the Lakota Nations territory and a powerful, sacred ceremony.

Before we started the trip, Rueben asked our friend Josh, an environmental lawyer, to draft something for the spiritual leaders to sign that would be like the Save the Fraser Declaration - a statement of sovereign authority for indigenous people to protect their land and water.

En route, Rueben's two children both shared their thoughts and feelings about the declaration, as did our other traveling companions, all participants in Rueben's sweat lodge ceremonies back home. After our long journey, we finally arrived at Crow Dog's Paradise, located on the Lakota Reservation in Rosebud, S.D.

Crow Dog's Paradise is a magical place. The sacred tree is covered in colourful prayer ties dancing in the wind. Bright dragonflies paint the air. The sound of the drums resonates deep inside your body. The sunrises turn the clouds into a pink gateway over the arbor's east gate. Spectacular rainbows follow the overpowering thunder and lightning of summer storms. All of this is home to Chief Leonard Crow Dog, a powerful spiritual leader and activist who has touched the lives of many, many people. Perhaps it should not be surprising that this place is so special, as the area is not far from where the legendary Crazy Horse once lived, hunted and did battle.

Crow Dog can trace his lineage back to a long line of Lakota medicine men. As the medicine man for the American Indian Movement, he played a critical role in bringing back traditional ceremonies that had almost been lost. He was part of the seven-month occupation of Wounded Knee in 1967, and many other actions in the fight for the sovereignty and strength of the Native American people. It was Crow Dog that made Rueben a Sundance Chief and this year was his 17th year in a row dancing in the sacred ceremony.

After the declaration was drafted there was a process of consulting with Chief Crow Dog and the other chiefs to revise the text. I will never forget the smile on Rueben's six-foot-five, 15-year-old son Cedar's face one day as he giggled and said, ""They just called for all the chiefs and Ben West … you better run"".

At first I didn't believe him because Cedar often gets me good with his practical jokes. I hadn't heard the announcement, but after I realized he wasn't joking I ran across the camp barefoot and then awkwardly sat down behind Rueben at this meeting of larger-than-life spiritual leaders as they discussed the declaration.

Cedar and I spent several afternoons driving back and forth to use the wi-fi in a nearby grocery store and the printer in a small town library in Mission, S.D., working on drafts and revisions to share with the Sun Dance chiefs. Later, Cedar and I were off across state lines into Valentine, Neb. for one final print run on the weekend when the library was closed. We found an embroidery shop that was open and they were nice enough to print a big version of the declaration to be signed by the leaders.

At last, the declaration was complete. It was a hot, dry day in the Arbor at the Sun Dance ceremony. Everyone listened silently as Rueben spoke, standing under the cedar bough roofs of the outer circle of the Arbor during a break between rounds of the ceremony. Over 600 people danced in the hot sun as part of Chief Leonard Crow Dog's Sun Dance ceremony this year, supported by thousands of others from across North America. Rueben has a rare ability to touch the hearts and minds of people, and when he finished reading all in attendance erupted with support. These chiefs and supporters had come from all the way from South America to Alaska. They lined up close to the west door of the arbor, all wearing stunning ceremonial regalia. They signed the declaration on Chief Leonard Crow Dog's desk as he watched and smiled approvingly.

Now half a year later Rueben was back in South Dakota last week taking his resolution to a gathering he organized along with Chief Phil Lane Jr. and others called ""Gathering to Protect the Sacred."" They were joined by native Americans and First Nations fighting the Keystone XL pipeline proposal and others fighting the Enbridge and Kinder Morgan pipelines. This time I wasn't able to join Ruben in person but I loved watching the live stream and blog from the event.

I feel strongly that as non-indigenous people living here in what we now call North America that we all have a lot to learn from those that were here long before we were. Working together, we need to find ways to heal from the history of colonialism and find new ways to work together to make healthy alternatives to dangerous tar sands oil, a reality. There are very real energy, housing and transportation solutions already readily available.

I sincerely hope that these challenges that we collectively face can provide an opportunity for cultural exchange, healing, empowerment and a clear pathway to move forward together.",https://www.benwest.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rueben-George-1024x1024.png,Ben West,2013-01-28 00:00:00+00,"[""indigenous"",""activism"",""pipelines"",""ceremony"",""solidarity"",""environment""]",true,2025-06-05 02:35:12.91442+00,2025-06-05 02:35:12.91442+00,admin,admin

One of Professor Kathryn Harrison’s posts caught my eye recently. It raised the question of whether having fewer children is an effective response to climate change. Her kids, Sophie and Sam Harrison, have been fighting climate change since they were young—a heartening reminder that the next generation is passionately involved. The post got me thinking about how we frame responsibility for the climate crisis. All too often, we hear that *personal* choices are the key: drive less, fly less, recycle, even have fewer children.

Spoiler alert: I don’t think focusing on personal choices—**especially** the decision to have kids—is the right way to address this emergency. We need to talk about the bigger picture and the systemic drivers of the crisis.

## Personal Choices vs. Systemic Change

A 2017 *Guardian* article [claimed](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children) that the single most effective thing you can do to reduce your carbon footprint is to have one fewer child. On the surface, it sounds logical—but it’s also a distraction. David Roberts at *Vox* [called this framing](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/7/26/16004062/kids-climate-change) “goofy,” and he’s right. The idea of attributing all of a hypothetical child’s emissions to a parent is not just impractical—it’s misleading.

If you’re not having 10 kids this year, are you suddenly a climate hero? Obviously not.

Even if population growth matters, targeting family size in wealthy countries misses the point. Emissions aren’t distributed equally. A single American child will emit more carbon than dozens of children in poorer countries. And it’s not just about which country you live in—the richest 10% globally are responsible for nearly half of all lifestyle emissions. The problem isn’t people having kids. It’s the ultra-wealthy and the corporations that profit from climate destruction.

## Beyond Personal Virtue: Solidarity Over Shame

Bethany Hindmarsh, writing in [GUTS Magazine](http://gutsmagazine.ca/motherearth-on/), captures the moral tension perfectly. Many young people are forgoing children—not because they don’t want them, but because they’ve internalized the guilt of contributing to climate change. That guilt is misplaced. As she notes, the only moral arguments that hold water are those based on *solidarity and imagination*.

Having children can be a radical act of hope. And for many parents in the climate movement, it’s also fuel for the fire—a reason to fight harder. Let’s focus on what kind of world we’re building *for* children, rather than framing them as carbon liabilities.

## The Pitfall of “DIY Climate Action”

A [study from Stanford](https://phys.org/news/2017-06-emphasizing-individual-solutions-big-issues.html) found that when people are encouraged to take personal climate action, they often become *less* likely to support systemic solutions like a carbon tax. Why? Because it makes them feel like they’ve already done their part. This isn't hypothetical—it’s a documented psychological effect.

We need both individual and systemic action. But the more we focus on solo lifestyle changes, the more we risk weakening public pressure for real policy reform. 

## The Long History of Blaming Individuals

This isn’t a new trick. The packaging industry created the “Keep America Beautiful” campaign in the 1950s to fight back against anti-littering laws. That famous “Crying Indian” ad? Pure corporate deflection. The real goal wasn’t to stop pollution—it was to stop regulation.

As [Orion Magazine](https://orionmagazine.org/article/the-new-abolitionists/) detailed, industry leaders rebranded waste as a *personal* problem. They trained the public to blame “litterbugs” instead of questioning the rise of single-use packaging. It worked. The same thing happened when BP pushed the concept of a “carbon footprint.” They weren’t doing that out of the goodness of their hearts—they wanted to make *you* feel responsible, not them.

## Bernays, Corporate Personhood & the Consent Machine

Edward Bernays—father of modern PR—literally wrote the book on this strategy. He helped sell cigarettes to women by branding smoking as feminist liberation. He invented the idea of bacon as a health food by convincing doctors to endorse it. His playbook: appeal to emotion, manipulate public perception, use “experts” to do your bidding.

Fast forward: the same tactics are being used by fossil fuel companies today. And they’re protected by law. Thanks to the doctrine of *corporate personhood*, companies can spend unlimited money on politics, claim free speech rights, and avoid meaningful accountability. They’ve rewritten the rules of democracy to serve themselves.

## Surveillance Capitalism and the New Oligarchy

If you think this ends with oil execs, think again. Tech billionaires like Peter Thiel—who once said “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible”—are reshaping public life through companies like Palantir. They’re building the infrastructure of surveillance, profiting from ICE raids and predictive policing, while quietly pushing anti-democratic ideals.

It’s not just what they *do*—it’s what they *believe*. Many of these figures see democracy as an obstacle, not a virtue. They prefer governance by algorithm, insulated from public accountability. And they’ve got the data, dollars, and platforms to make it happen.

## From “Me” to “We”

It’s time to shift the conversation. Climate action isn’t about shame or guilt—it’s about power. About who holds it, who uses it, and who gets left behind. Individual choices can be meaningful, but they’re most powerful when they feed into collective movements.

So yes—change your lightbulbs. Ride your bike. Eat less meat. But more importantly: **organize**, **vote**, **protest**, and **build the systems** that make low-carbon living the norm, not the exception. Let’s stop letting corporations write the rules while we argue over composting bins.

This isn’t about being perfect. It’s about being together.
