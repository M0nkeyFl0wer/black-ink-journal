## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **React Router**: Client-side routing

### Backend (Supabase)
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database
- **Storage**: File upload and management
- **Auth**: User authentication system
- **Real-time**: Live updates (if needed)

### Key Components
- `AdminLogin.tsx`: Authentication interface
- `AdminDashboard.tsx`: Post management dashboard
- `AdminPostEditor.tsx`: Rich post editor
- `RichTextEditor.tsx`: WYSIWYG text editor
- `DynamicBlogPost.tsx`: Public post display

1. Edit `AdminLogin.tsx`
2. Update the hardcoded credentials in the `handleSubmit` function

### Adding Features
Common extensions:
